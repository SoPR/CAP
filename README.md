## Community Action Proposal Repository
Here we will list all open proposals to the Startups of Puerto Rico community until we figure out a better system. All proposals must follow the spec specified in the latest version of the [CAP Format document](https://github.com/SoPR/FoundingDocuments/blob/master/sopr-cap-format.md).

### How to submit a CAP
If you know and understand GIT and GitHub you can submit a pull request to this repository. Make sure you add your CAP to the list of active CAPs. If you don't just create your proposal as an [issue right here](https://github.com/SoPR/CAP/issues). One of the repo maintainers will turn it into a proper file and will submit a pull request on your behalf.
